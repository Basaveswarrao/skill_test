# Shell script to query the value.
## Challenge3:
We have a nested object, we would like a function that you pass in the object and a key and get back the value. How this is implemented is up to you.
Example Inputs
object = {“a”:{“b”:{“c”:”d”}}}

key = a/b/c

object = {“x”:{“y”:{“z”:”a”}}}

key = x/y/z

value = a
